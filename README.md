You'll start at the East of the two main islands with Three land ships and one amphibious apc, to go to them simply follow the lights on the closest door and then just follow the lights. To load the willis and build a fob:

--------------------------TO BUILD FOB----------------------------------------

1- Descend stairs

2- get into the Willis Jeep

3- point to the landing craft

4- On action box select "load vehicle"

5- go to the water near the landing craft door/ramp and keep trying to make appear the "get in" action getting close to the door.

6- now drive to a shore/beach and on a FLAT FRONT SURFACE!!! select action "Unload all vehicles".

7- the same for the other boats.


Take out radio towers to disable reinforcements in local area.

capture the Supllies Factory (Marked with fuel markers) to buy cars and tanks.

MEANING OF EACH FUEL MARKERS NAME:

[A] = Ammo

[S] = Supplies

[F] = Fuel

You can manage your resources at base with the logistics menu at the scrool menu on the FOB range. To buy vehicle units and buldings go to the build menu at the scrool menu at the FOB range.

Also if you don't want a unit or vehicle anymore build the recycle facility and then recycle the vehicle or unit.

Also remember that capturing bass mean high enemy activity. SO do the side missions. To activate side missions you'll need intel points that you get capturing surrender enemy units, and capturing radios and wallets and documents. Activate by taking the Prisioneer to the FOB. To do the side mission use the scrool menu at the FOB location. And watch the map to see the mission location.

Another way to do it, is finding my github version. and downloading it to a workspace of your preference. and changing the "zeus_synchro.sqf". To find it press at your mission folder ctrl+F, and type the "zeus_synchro.sqf"

There you'll make everything that is -1e8 to 0.

NOW you go to the "mission.sqm" and find this:

"property="ModuleCurator_F_Addons";"

under these lines change the scalar from 0 to 3.

another way is going to the the arma 3 default 3den misions folder. and pasting the mission folder there. and open in editor select the zeus module and change the parameters from the none to all mods including unofficial ones.

that's it. further more to know I must learn. play fair, have fun. Don't mind my grammar mistakes.
